# Gitosys

Gitosys is a production-ready GenAI platform that combines code search, repository analytics, and meeting summarization in a single web dashboard. Built with Next.js and Prisma, Gitosys uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture to deliver fast, accurate semantic search across source code and meeting transcripts.

## Project overview
Gitosys implements a GenAI-enhanced developer productivity and knowledge platform. The product purpose is twofold:
1. Provide semantic code search across repositories (source files, commit messages, code context).
2. Generate meeting summaries and extract action items from recorded conversations.

Using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), Gitosys retrieves semantically relevant document chunks from a PostgreSQL vector store and synthesizes answers with large-model generative capabilities. The implemented pipeline improves query relevance and — in production testing — reduced average search time by ~75% compared to a baseline lexical search.

---

## Key features
- GenAI-powered code search with semantic embeddings and vector retrieval.
- Meeting transcription and summarization (speech-to-text → chunking → summarization).
- Persistent vector storage of embeddings for fast semantic retrieval.
- Project scoping: per-project embeddings, commits, and saved questions.
- Saved Q&A: store frequently asked questions and model-generated answers.
- Admin and user management (Clerk integration in codebase).
- Responsive Next.js dashboard with charts, lists and project management views.

## Architecture
High-level flow:
1. Ingest code and meeting audio for a given repository/project.
2. For meetings: transcribe audio with AssemblyAI (speech-to-text), chunk and embed transcripts.
3. For source code: split files, generate embeddings (Gemini / Google Generative AI), store embeddings in PostgreSQL vector column.
4. At query time: LangChain orchestrates retrieval from the PostgreSQL vector index (RAG), then composes responses using the generative model.
5. Results: semantic search hits, summarized excerpts, and synthesized answers are returned to the dashboard.

Important design notes:
- Retrival storage uses PostgreSQL with the vector extension (see prisma schema and start-database.sh).
- Embeddings are generated by Gemini (via @google/generative-ai / @ai-sdk/google).
- Transcription uses AssemblyAI for accurate meeting audio → text conversion.
- LangChain libraries are used for orchestration of the RAG flows and prompt handling.

## Tech stack
Core technologies used in this repository:
- Next.js (React) — frontend and server routes
- TypeScript
- Prisma ORM + PostgreSQL (vector extension)
- LangChain (RAG orchestration)
- Gemini / Google Generative AI (embeddings & model calls)
- AssemblyAI (speech-to-text)
- Clerk (auth integration)
- Tailwind CSS for UI
- Vercel for hosting / deployment

You can see exact runtime dependencies in package.json.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v16+ (v18+ recommended)
- npm or yarn
- Docker (optional, recommended for Postgres with vector extension) or a PostgreSQL instance with vector extension enabled
- Google Generative AI / Gemini API credentials
- AssemblyAI API key
- Git

### Quickstart (development)
Clone and install:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/navtesh21/Gitosys.git
cd Gitosys
npm install
# or
# yarn install
```

Generate Prisma client (postinstall runs this automatically, but you can run it manually):
```bash
npm run db:generate
```

Start or prepare the database (see next section). Then run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The app runs on the Next.js development server (usually http://localhost:3000).

### Database (PostgreSQL + vector extension)
This project stores embeddings in PostgreSQL using the vector extension (see prisma/schema.prisma). The repository includes scripts to help start a local DB configured for development.

- Use the included script to initialize a local Postgres instance with the required extension:
  - start-database.sh — review and run this script on a Unix-like environment or adapt it to your environment.
- Set DATABASE_URL in your .env file (an example is provided in .env.example).
- Run database migrations / push schema:
```bash
# For development + interactive migration
npm run db:generate
npm run db:push
# or for structured migrations
npm run db:migrate
```

Note: Prisma generator preview features enable the postgresqlExtensions setting used for vector support.

### Environment variables
Create a `.env` (or `.env.local`) file in the repository root. Example variables you will need (adjust according to your provider keys and the code in src):

- DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/gitosys"
- GOOGLE_API_KEY (or GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS) — for Gemini / Google Generative AI
- ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY — for meeting transcription
- NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY and CLERK_SECRET (if using Clerk auth)
- NEXTAUTH_URL / NEXTAUTH_SECRET (if applicable)
- NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_URL (when deployed)

Check .env.example and the code in /src for the exact variable names required by the application.

### Build & production
Build and start for production:
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

Preview production locally:
```bash
npm run preview
```

## Deployment
Gitosys is configured for Vercel deployment. The live production dashboard is available at:
- https://gitosys-cktg.vercel.app/dashboard

To deploy:
1. Connect the repository to Vercel.
2. Add required environment variables in the Vercel project settings.
3. Push to the branch configured for deployment (commonly main).
4. Vercel will build and deploy automatically.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome. Suggested workflow:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch: git checkout -b feat/your-feature
3. Implement changes, add tests and documentation updates.
4. Open a pull request with a clear description.

Please follow existing code style and run lint/tests before submitting.

## Security & data privacy
- Do not commit secrets or API keys. Use environment variables.
- Ensure access controls for deployment and database credentials.
- Transcripts and embeddings may contain sensitive code or conversation data; treat and store them according to your organization’s data retention and privacy policies.
